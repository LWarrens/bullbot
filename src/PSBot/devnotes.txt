Because our local simulator (which we use to do tree search rollouts) is not an
entirely accurate simulation of the mechanics, sometimes a move will be marked
valid when it is not. Trying to send such a move to Pokemon Showdown will result
in a bot crash. However, we still need both of these pieces of information
(what's legal in our good-enough simulator, and what's ACTUALLY legal).

Pokemon Showdown (moves sento to server MUST be in this form):
ATTACK:
range: [1, 4]
SWITCH:
range: [2, 6]

PSUser (our parser and interface to PS) will collect and send move legality like
this:
ATTACK:
range: [0, 3]
SWITCH:
range: [4, 8]

Simulator (our backend simulator to rollout lots of quasi realistic games) will
collect and send move legality like this:;
ATTACK:
range: [0, 3]
SWITCH:
range: [4, 8]
